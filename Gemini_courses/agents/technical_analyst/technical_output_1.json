/*
- "timeframe X" (int) is the timeframe on which the returns are made or calculated. There must be a short term timeframe and a higher one, e.g. 5 mn and 1 h (60 mn).
- "support X" (float) is the technical support of the graph. Higher is X, farer is the support line below the reference point.
- "resistance X" (float) is the technical resistance of the graph. Higher is X, farer is the resistance line above the reference point.
- "graphical trend" ("+", "." or "-") is the direction of the graphical trend for the related timeframe.
- "RSI trend" ("+", "." or "-") is the direction of the RSI trend for the related timeframe.
- "MACD" ("+", "." or "-") is the direction of the MACD trend for the related timeframe.
- Bollinger bands or similar (?).
- Volume analysis (?).

Notes:
- The type of the returned datas must be clearly thought to define the well related data base.
- Trends, previously defined with "+" (increase), "." (no trend), "-" (decrease) can also be done with trignometic values (the same than on a trigonometric circle).
  Using trigonometric values can lead to define polynomila functions; a reference point might be needed and as x axis is a discret axis and y axis a continuous axis 
    both on different values, the axes might be scaled for coherency.
  For example, in the case of trigonometric values, it can be returned in a list of X, Y tuple: [(x1, y1), (x2, y2), (x3, y3), ...]
  Also symbols ("+" and "-") can eventually be repeated up to 5 times according to the strengh of the trend.
  Trends can be an hybrid of trigonometric values and symbols.
