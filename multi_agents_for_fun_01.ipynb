      "Réponse: Tesla, Inc. is an American manufacturer of electric vehicles, solar panels, and automobile batteries. It was founded in 2003 by American entrepreneurs Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning and was named after Serbian American inventor Nikola Tesla. Elon Musk, an early investor in the company, became CEO in 2008. Tesla has ambitious goals for its new Roadster: hit 60 mph in 1.9 seconds and achieve a range of 620 miles. Fittingly, prices will start around $200,000. Fittingly, prices will start around $200,000. 2024 Tesla Model 3 Long Range Rear-Wheel Drive: $44,130 The updated 2024 Tesla Model 3 is a solid upgrade over the outgoing model. It offers a quieter cabin, slight exterior tweaks, a more refined ... Overall, Tesla's profits took a hit in 2024, with net income dropping to $8.4 billion, marking a 23% drop from 2023 and an even steeper 40% decline from its record $14.1 billion profit in 2022 ... Tesla Motors continues to defy automotive norms, and the norm that it scoffs at routinely is the tradition of annual model-year updates. Instead, electric vehicle maker introduces changes on their own schedule, making it challenging to pinpoint when updates appear on U.S. vehicles.Tesla's approach ensures innovation remains at the forefront while confounding those used to yearly changes.\n"
